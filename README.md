## Swagger generated server

### Overview

This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  
By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core), you can easily generate a server stub.  
This is an example of building a swagger-enabled server in Java using the SpringBoot framework.  

The underlying library integrating swagger to SpringBoot is [springfox](https://github.com/springfox/springfox).

### Server Port

Change default server port value in `src/main/resources/application.properties`. By default the port is `-1`.

### Starting a local server

First, package the project on terminal:

> mvn package

Then you can start your server as an simple java application:

> java -jar target/swagger-spring-1.0.0.jar

When the server is up and running, it allows the visualization of the API documentation in swagger-ui by pointing to (default port):

> http://localhost:8080/saqueepague/SepTransaction/1.17.0/
